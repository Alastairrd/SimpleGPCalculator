This was a project to help me with my bar management admin, and a way to practice object oriented programming in C#.

It utilises factories, and a View/Viewmodel/Models system.

It features a rock / paper / scissors - esque calculator.
It is able to swap between cost price, sale price, and gross profit margin percentage, given that the other two values are known.

It can be upgraded to display more clearly, and feature better input checking.
